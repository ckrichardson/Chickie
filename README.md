This is a bot written for the r/UNR discord server.   It comes with a suite of tools for moderation, local weather (such as AQI), as well as some minigame projects that 
are implemented for the sake of fun.

Written in Python3.

**ONLY COMPATIBLE FOR LINUX**

To run from your own machine, run 
```
chmod +x install

Make sure to obtain a Discord API key as well as an OWM api key, then export them to your environment variables.
