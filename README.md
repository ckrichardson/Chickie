# Chickie

This is a bot written for the r/UNR discord server.   It comes with a suite of tools for moderation, local weather (such as AQI), as well as some minigame projects that 
are implemented for the sake of fun.

Written in Python3.

**ONLY COMPATIBLE FOR LINUX (specifically Ubuntu 18.04)**

To run from your own machine, run 
```
chmod +x install
./install
./run
```

Make sure to obtain a Discord API key as well as an OWM api key, then export them to your environment variables.

Current Goals:
- Implement new, useful features requested by the community
- Write unit tests 
- Write pythonic error handling
